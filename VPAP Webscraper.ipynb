    "### *Introduction*\n",
    "While trying to do econometric research, I have been frequently disappointed by the lack of data reporting from American institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the API of VA Department of Elections to download campaign finance information, publishes the individual reports during a filing period. Aggregating data is, thus, very time consuming. This makes analysis of political contributions much more difficult and much more rare. The data is also self-reported by the campaigns who have an incentive to be dishonest. This also means that there is wild variation in listed industries for donors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virginia Public Access Project has stepped up to compile all the individual campaign finance reports and make it more accessible to the public on their website (https://www.vpap.org/). They also remove the street addresses from the donors' mailing address since the Dept. of Elections lists those. While it is much easier to find the data and VPAP does have useful graphics, aggregate data is not available which is necessary for statistical analysis. As such, I wanted to collect and structure VPAP data to create useable (analysis-ready) data. I chose the local level for convenience (this is my first independent webscraper project). \n",
    "\n",
    "### *Overview*\n",
    "\n",
    "I webscraped publicly available data from the Virginia Public Access Project website for political contributions to local candidates in Spotsylvania, VA by Spotsylvania donors for the period of January 1, 2015 - December 2, 2020. I exported this information to a csv file (including the donor, the donor's employer, the donor's industry, the recipient, the amount, and the date of the contribution). However, not all donations had this information and much was left as \"Unknown.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the link to the first page of search results on VPAP for donors in the Spotsylvania locality for\n",
    "all Spotsylvania donors to local Candidates: 2015 - Present (Dec. 2, 2020).\n",
    "https://www.vpap.org/localities/spotsylvania-county-va/donors/?start_year=2015&end_year=2020&recip_type=local_cands\n",
    "\n",
    "There are twenty five pages of results. The results only give the name of the donor and the total amount they gave. I navigated to the donor page from the results to get the name of the recipients but it listed the total they donated during the 2015-2020 time period and the recipient. I then navigated to the donor's recipient page from the previous page and I gathered the date and amount of the contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, this will serve as a reporting tool that can be expanded to increase civic knowledge. This is my first independently made webscraper so please let me know of ways to improve the program. Some code chunks take some time to run."
