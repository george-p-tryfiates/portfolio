Programming and Data Analysis projects

Please feel free to browse each project to see my data analysis process.

The COVID project visualizes the differences in the share of VA COVID-19 deaths in each county in 2020 to the county's share of the VA population 
(based on the UVA Welden Cooper Center population estimates). This involved finding legitimate data sources, wrangling the dataframes together, and 
visualizing data on a map all using R programming.

In the VPAP project, I used Python to webscrape campaign contributions from local donors to local candidates during the period of Jan. 1, 2015 - Dec. 31, 2020 
available on the Virginia Public Access Project website. I exported that data to a csv and cleaned it in R. I also made various summary tables and visualizations of the data.
