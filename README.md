Programming and Data Analysis projects

Please feel free to browse each project to see my data analysis process.

Each project serves as a technical proof-of-concept of things that will be features in another. I want to make the public financial, voting, and social media data of elected representatives and candidates more accessible to the public (I will refer to representatives as candidates from now on for simplicity). In reporting the data, I want the relationships between donor and candidate charcteristics and quantify if changes in candidate behavior is quantifiable or predictable. The collected dataset needs to be sufficiently large and clean to enable causal inference and statistical analysis of relationships. My research interests in voting systems, public choice, and the role of information in preference expression.

The COVID-19 project visualizes the differences in the share of VA COVID-19 mortalities in each county in 2020 to the county's share of the VA population (based on the UVA Welden Cooper Center population estimates). This involved data collection, wrangling dataframes together, and visualizing data on a map using R programming.

In the VPAP project, I used Python to collect public data on campaign contributions during the period of Jan. 1, 2015 - Dec. 31, 2020 
available on the Virginia Public Access Project website. From three sitemap levels I exported that data to a csv and cleaned it in R. I also made various summary tables and visualizations of the data.
